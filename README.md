# Word-Count
In a Java course, we were tasked with printing the frequencies of all words in an arbitraty test file. I decided to also write it in C++ to explore some differences between the two. Some sample txt files are provided. *For now, words with different capitalizations are considered different words until I have time to update it*. The header and header 
implementation files were to learn how to use those.
